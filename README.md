# lift-fortech

## This is a lift simulator written in html and javascript.
You can use the lifts pushing the Call Elevator button. Always the closest lift will come to pick you up.
Inside the lift you can find the floor buttons, by pressing them the elevator will take you to that floor.
If the two lifts are at the same distance to the floor where the lift was called always the one closest to the floor will come to pick you up.
